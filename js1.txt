# Functions

#Example
function <function-name> (<args>,<args>) {
<body>;
return <var>; # if needed
}

<function-name>(<args>,<args>); #calling function
<Var>=<function-name>(<args>,<args>);

#scope in fuction
-Types:
Global , local

#note: "typeof <var>" returns the type of data in the variable
creating a variable using "<name>;" is global variable and creating a variable using "let <name>;" is a 
local variable that can be only be used within the scope
"<name>;" only inside a function var<name>; inside afuntion is local variable

#var s = JSON.stringify(<Variable>); #converts the data to string

#Boolean value = true , false

#Comparison operators
== equality operator 
=== strict equality operator
#g:
3 == 3 #true in both case
3 === '3' #true in '==' and false in '==='

Loops
1. If:
IF is used to execute a block of code based on a condition.

Syntax
if(condition){
    // code
}
2. If-Else:
Else part is used to execute the block of code when the condition fails.

Syntax
if(condition){
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
3. Switch:
Switch is used to replace nested If-Else statements.

Syntax
switch(condition){
    case 'value1' :
        //code
        [break;]
    case 'value2' :
        //code
        [break;]
    .......
    default :
        //code
        [break;]
}
4. For
For loop is used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition.

for(Initialization; Condition; Increment/decrement){  
//code  
} 
5. While
While is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. Usually while is preferred when number of ierations is not known in advance.

while (condition) {  
  // code 
}  
6. Do-While
Do-while is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. It is mostly used when you need to execute the statements atleast once.

do {  
  // code 
} while (condition); 
Classes
ES6 introduced classes along with OOPS concepts in JS. Class is similar to a function which you can think like kind of template which will get called when ever you initialize class.

Syntax:
class className {
  constructor() { ... } //Mandatory Class method
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  ...
}
Example:
class Mobile {
  constructor(model) {
    this.name = model;
  }
}

mbl = new Mobile("iPhone");

Try:

try {
  /* code */
} catch (e) {}
